# fountain-of-dreams

An internet radio with a Node.js backend and React frontend. Radio is mainly focused on 70's/80's Japanese tunes. There wasn't a radio for this type of music (even though it had a huge resurgence in popularity), so i decided to build my own! Heavily inspired by plaza.one, another radio.
